# DataVisualization_MichelleBeckner

Summary:

I chose to examine the dataset on baseball data. The dataset contained information on baseball playerâ€™s statistics such as batting average, handedness, height, weight, and home runs. I became curious if batting averages were affected by handedness, height, or weight. I decided to look at a small segment of the baseball players. I chose the baseball players with the top 10 batting averages. After looking at the data and visualizations, the only interesting correlation I saw was that most baseball players with top batting averages were left-handed.


Design:

As I was thinking about how to approach the design of my visuals, I decided I wanted to focus on one aspect of the data compared to multiple other factors. I also wanted to show the information in a variety of ways while keeping the graphs simple and easy to understand. After receiving feedback on the first draft of my story, I edited the sheet titles to make them consistent with the information being shown. I had changed my focus from Home Run Average to the Batting Average. However, I did not change the titles of the slides. I also added more verbiage in the story panes to allow the view to see more of the direction of the story. 

Feedback:

I had my roommate Phaedra Fayad review my story. The feedback I received was:
Visualizations were good and easy to understand.
Titles did not match up to what the data was showing
The story did not really explain the thought process of the progression of the story.
