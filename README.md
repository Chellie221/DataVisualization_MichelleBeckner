Summary:

I chose to examine the dataset on baseball data. The dataset contained information on baseball playerâ€™s statistics such as batting average, handedness, height, weight, and home runs. I became curious if batting averages were affected by handedness, height, or weight. I decided to look at a small segment of the baseball players. I chose the baseball players with the top 10 batting averages. After looking at the data and visualizations, the only interesting correlation I saw was that most baseball players with top batting averages were left-handed.


Design:

As I was thinking about how to approach the design of my visuals, I decided I wanted to focus on one aspect of the data compared to multiple other factors. I also wanted to show the information in a variety of ways while keeping the graphs simple and easy to understand. In looking at how many of the top 10 batting average players were left, right or both handed, I choose color circles. I didn't really want to compare among the players but just get an idea for how many were left handed, right handed or left and right handed. The colored circles show at glance that most of the top 10 players were left handed. For the weight, I wanted to compare the weight amount the players so I chose to vary the size of the circles. The heighest weights have the biggest circles. I then wanted to the compare the differences in heights amoung the players so I chose a bar graph to easily show the differences. After receiving feedback on the first draft of my story, I edited the sheet titles to make them consistent with the information being shown. I had changed my focus from Home Run Average to the Batting Average. However, I did not change the titles of the slides. I also added more verbiage in the story panes to allow the view to see more of the direction of the story. 

Feedback:

I had my roommate Phaedra Fayad review my story. The feedback I received was:
Visualizations were good and easy to understand.
Titles did not match up to what the data was showing
The story did not really explain the thought process of the progression of the story.
